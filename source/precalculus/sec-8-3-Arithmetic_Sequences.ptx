    <title>Arithmetic Sequences and Series</title>
    <p><em>Arithmetic Sequences and Series</em> establishes the notation used for sequences in 
        general and covers the standard types of problems involving arithmetic sequences. Connections 
        are made to similar problems involving equations of lines. In particular, the explicit 
        formula for an arithmetic sequence is given as <m>a_n = d(n) + a_0</m>. This differs from 
        others formulation of <m>a_n = a_1 + d(n - 1)</m> as the former more closely matches the 
        slope-intercept form of a line <m>y = mx + b</m>. The standard technique to find the 
        sum of an arithmetic series is presented.</p>
