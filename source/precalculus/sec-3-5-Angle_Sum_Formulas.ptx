    <title>Angle Sum Formulas</title>
    <p><em>Angle Sum Formulas</em> covers the calculation aspects of working with 
        the angle sum formulas. It is assumed the students already know each formula, 
        as no attempt to derive them is made here. They are most commonly proved by geometric 
        means, but we prefer a more algebraic approach which can be found in the 
        corresponding in-class activity.</p>
