    <title>Bell Curve</title>
    <p>This lesson discussed the <em>bell curve</em> as a limit, but without the 
        formalities necessary to truly talk about the <em>Central Limit Theorem</em>. The lesson 
        begins with some <em>binomial distributions</em> to develop an understanding of where 
        the bell curve comes from. The standardization process (<m>z</m>-scores) are discussed with 
        examples. Additionally, examples involving confidence intervals are presented, 
        though no attempt is made to discuss the formalities of <em>Hypothesis Testing</em>.</p>
