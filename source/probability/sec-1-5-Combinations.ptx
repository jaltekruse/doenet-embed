    <title>Combinations</title>
    <p>This lesson develops an understanding of Combinations as they 
        relate to <xref ref="sec-1-3-Permutations" text="title"/>. The connection between ordered lists 
        (Permutations) and unordered sets (Combinations) is of fundamental 
        importance and time should be spent developing this connection. The 
        recursion of Pascalâ€™s Triangle and its connection to the recursion for 
        Combinations is presented here. That connection is also of fundamental 
        importance in understanding probability. This idea is also used in the  
        standard formula for calculating binomial probabilities (<em>i.e.</em> calculating 
        using the Binomial Distribution).</p>
