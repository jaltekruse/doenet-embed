  <title>Counting Techniques</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>This chapter studies functions, the associated notation, and key ideas necessary for 
        analyzing graphs in calculus. The material here is background material for the chapter on 
        Exponential and Logarithmic Functions and it is wise to review the sections on Inverse 
        Functions prior to discussing logarithms. The latter half of the chapter can be skipped 
        until it is needed for logarithms. Domain, Range and Composition of Functions are also 
        discussed.</p>
