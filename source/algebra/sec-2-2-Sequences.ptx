    <p><em>Sequences</em> discusses recursive patterns that lead to sequences of numbers and 
        the associated notation. Examples include 
        <xref ref="sec-2-3-Linear_Growth_and_Arithmetic_Sequences">Arithmetic Sequences</xref> and 
        <xref ref="sec-2-4-Exponential_Growth_and_Geometric_Sequences">Geometric Sequences</xref>, 
        but details of those two topics including their explicit formulas are saved for later lessons.</p>
