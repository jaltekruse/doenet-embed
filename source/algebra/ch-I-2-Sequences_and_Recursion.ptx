  <title>Sequences and Recursion</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>This chapter develops the notation used in defining sequences. The emphasis is on recursive definitions 
        and the patterns that follow. The connection between multiplication and repeated addition results in an 
        explicit formula for arithmetic sequences. Likewise, the connection between exponents and repeated 
        multiplication leads to an explicit formula for geometric sequences. The connections between the recursive 
        and explicit definitions is emphasized and the focus is primarily on the recursive nature of these sequences. 
        The mathematics presented gives students a conceptual understanding of the recursive capacity involved 
        in programming a spreadsheet.</p>
