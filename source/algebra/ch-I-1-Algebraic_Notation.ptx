  <title>Algebraic Notation </title>

  <introduction>
    <p>This chapter recaps the prerequisite material necessary for the study of algebraic 
        concepts in preparation for taking a course in Calculus. The assumption is that students are 
        already familiar with this material, therefore the presentation is intentionally brief. The 
        major focus is working with polynomials and rational expressions, specifically expanding and 
        factoring polynomials, and the arithmetic of fractions/rational expressions. Laws of Exponents 
        are also introduced. These ideas are expanded upon in later chapters: Polynomials and Rational 
        Expressions are connected to their graphs in the chapter on Quadratics, Polynomials and Rational 
        Expressions and the Laws of Exponents are crucial for the chapter on Exponential and 
        Logarithmic Functions.</p>
