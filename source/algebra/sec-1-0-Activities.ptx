  <!-- <introduction>
    <p>This book covers the major topics within the study of algebra, 
      including equations of lines and parabolas. General polynomial and 
      rational functions as well as exponential and logarithmic functions 
      are addressed. The idea of recursion plays an important role early 
      in this work and attention is paid to the concept of a function and 
      the associated notation. At the University of Minnesota, this material 
      is used in the PreCalculus I course, which is the first of a two semester
      sequence leading to calculus. It comprises approximately 14 weeks worth 
      of material at the college level; a typical college student would spend 
      120-140 hours total learning this material.</p>

     <p>These materials are used as part of an active learning course, and 
      the interplay between in-class activities that allow students to 
      explore and discover ideas and a more formulaic study of the necessary 
      computations is important. Each chapter has suggestions for active 
      learning problem-solving activities designed to develop higher-order 
      thinking skills. The video lessons in the chapter sections address a 
      second objective, the skill-building component of mathematics. Can you 
      successfully carry out the calculations necessary to find answers to a 
      variety of applications? Conceptual understanding of the material is 
      important, and instructors are encouraged make use of activities that 
      help students advance the computational skills developed in the video 
      lessons.</p>
      
      <p>This video textbook project has been funded by the University of 
        Minnesota School of Mathematics and by grants from the University of 
        Minnesota Libraries Partnership for Affordable Content. My thanks go 
        out to the many people who have contributed to this project including 
        Susan Tade, Jennifer Englund, Colin Marron, Hue Yang, Andrew Matthews, 
        James Ondrey and Melissa Olson with the University of Minnesota’s 
        Academic Technology Support Services for their assistance with the 
        recording, animation and post-production of the videos, Robbie Hank, 
        Shelley Kandola and other instructors who helped with the design of 
        the Beamer slideshows that form the basis of the visual presentation, 
        Stan Pride, Kevin Charles, Alex Duhaime, Liz Anderson and others who 
        have helped with other aspects of video editing to enhance the student 
        experience, David Ernst for being the catalyst of the entire project 
        by developing the Open Textbook Network and Kristi Jensen, Shane 
        Nackerud and others with the University of Minnesota Libraries who 
        have made this vision come to life in the final production stages.</p>

  <title>Activities - Chapter 1</title>
  
  <aside><title>Note to Students:</title>
  <p>Students should be aware that these worksheets are not ‘fill in the blank’ worksheets. 
    We have intentionally given you no space to write answers on the worksheets. You 
    should have a notebook for your work, perhaps even beginning by sketching ideas on a 
    white board or scratch paper until you have sufficient organization to put a coherent 
    explanation in your notebook. Note also that the expectation is to write ‘explanations’ 
    and not ‘answers’. These activities are not designed to teach computational skills, 
    but instead are designed to introduce mathematical concepts. The process used to solve 
    problems is the focus, not the end result.</p>

  <exercise><title>1a - Multiplication via the FOIL Method</title>
  <p>This first activity reviews multiplication, starting with the algorithm for 
    multiplying two digit numbers. Students may bring a variety of techniques to 
    the discussion, and it is important to see multiple representations. One important 
    aspect of learning mathematics is to be able to make connections between different 
    approaches that solve the same problem. The insights from multiplying two digit 
    numbers should lead to insights on the FOIL process.</p>
  </exercise>

  <!-- Part II of this activity is for more advanced students. It leads toward the Binomial Theorem and the connection to the theory of probability
  
  Multiplication via the FOIL Method
  
  Activity 1b – Factoring
  This activity builds the fundamentals of the factoring process. The `Box Method’ is used to demonstrate certain principles, though students may have a variety of methods that work. Again, the goal here is to share ideas, approach the problem from multiple perspectives, and understand the connections between various approaches.
  
  Factoring
  
  Activity 1c – Reducing Fractions
  This activity reviews the basics of reducing fractions by factoring. The topic begins with numerators and denominators which are integers before progressing to polynomials. It is important that students understand the factoring process and why terms that are added can’t be cancelled.
