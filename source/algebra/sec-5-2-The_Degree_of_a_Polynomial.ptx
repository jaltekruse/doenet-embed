    <title>The Degree of a Polynomial</title>
    <p><em>The Degree of a Polynomial</em> takes a constructionist viewpoint to 
        create the set of polynomials from real numbers, an indeterminant 
        variable <m>x</m>, and the operations of addition and multiplication. 
        The definitions of polynomial, term and degree are given. The main 
        point of this lesson is to prepare students for a discussion 
        of Parabolas as polynomials of degree = 2.</p>
