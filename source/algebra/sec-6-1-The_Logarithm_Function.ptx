    <title>The Logarithm Function</title>
    <p><em>The Logarithm Function</em> is developed as the inverse to the exponential function, 
        and these connections are stressed throughout, including later in the topic 
        <xref ref="./sec-6-2-Properties_of_Logarithms" text="title"/>. The 
        domain and range of both the exponential and logarithm functions are 
        dealt with, though no attempt is made here to have students solve for the 
        domain of a logarithmic function.</p>
