  <title>Lines and Linear Equations</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>This chapter links to the previous material on 
        Arithmetic Sequences and the focus is on rates of change and slopes. 
        <xref ref="sec-4-1-Solving_a_Linear_Eq_One_Variable" text="title"/> is this first of several 
        solution processes 
        that appear in the next few chapters. The common forms of lines are introduced. There 
        is an activity on finding the intersection of two lines that foreshadows solving a  
        <m>2 \times 2</m> system of liner equations. There is also a section that connects the 
        <xref ref="sec-4-6-Point_Slope_Form" text="title" /> to graphs transformations that are covered in the chapter on 
        <xref ref="ch-I-5-Quadratics_Polynomials_and_Rational_Expressions" text="title"/>.</p>
