  <title>Reducing Fractions</title>
    
    <p><em>Reducing Fractions</em> covers the process to write a rational expression in
    reduced form, by cancelling common factors. The subtle difference between 
    <m>\displaystyle \frac{(x+3)(x-2)}{(x-2)}</m> and the reduced form <m>(x+3)</m> is
    not discussed as it would be in a calculus course, though this may be of interest to advanced
    students. This lesson relies on a knowledge of <em>Factoring Polynomials</em>.
